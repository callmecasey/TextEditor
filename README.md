#Text-Editor

## Description

The task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## User Story

AS A developer,
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a text editor web application:

- WHEN I open my application in my editor,
  THEN I should see a client server folder structure.
- WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory,
  THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client.
- WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal,
  THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.
- WHEN I run my webpack plugins,
  THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
- WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application,
  THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.
- WHEN I open the text editor,
  THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
- WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window,
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.
- WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it,
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.
- WHEN I click on the Install button,
  THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop.
- WHEN I load my web application,
  THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox.
- WHEN I register a service worker,
  THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.
- WHEN I deploy to Render
  THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application.
